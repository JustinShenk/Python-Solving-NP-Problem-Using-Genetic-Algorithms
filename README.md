# Python-Solving-Travelling-Salesman-Problem-Using-Genetic-Algorithm
Exploring different ways of solving NP-Hard problems using genetic algorithms.

[This is a repo of few experiments by me trying to figure out different/better ways of crossovers,mutations and representation of inputs]
TODO:
- Plot graphs for various crosover methods and their solutions.
- try solving other NP-[X] algos!
